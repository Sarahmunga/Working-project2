## TANZANIA WATER PUMPS PREDICTION

For this work project, we used types of models to predict the status of the pumps in the republic of Tanzania.This analysis of Tanzanian water pump data was done in order to provide the Non government stakeholders a tool which will determine faulty and functional water pumps as well information on how to improve pump maintenance efficiency.In this analysis we will focus on determining which factors needs attention to increase efficiency of the water pumps. The Non government stakeholders can use this analysis to improve prediction and identification of which pumps are non functional or needs repair, therefore increasing access to potable water across Tanzania.



## Business Problem 
The Tanzania Government is trying to improve their water pump maintenance operations in order to ensure that clean, potable water is available to communities across Tanzania. In order to accomplish this, the Non government stakeholder wants to be able to better predict which pumps will fail, and to better identify pumps that need repair and what factors need to be considered in the future. This will help in improving maintenance efficiency and water access.
## Data
The data set has different variables that describes the pump status (the target variable),The geographical location of the pump, what kind of pump is operating, date of installation, etc. The data has 59,400 entries of individual pumps recorded from  the year 2011to 2013.
## Data Preparation
For this section, we did all the cleaning of the data that is required. Removal of columns, replacing missing values and ensuring the data is ready for analysis.
## visualization
we did different tye of visualization, we visualized the amount in tsh, pumps against population and location vs status of the pump
